# ðŸ‘€Â Problem

- At the moment itâ€™s difficult for web3 companies/entities to receive funding and loans for growth against the on-chain (and off-chain) revenue. For the space the grow, funding is key. Traditional financial institutions do not have the know-how to serve them.
    - Types of customers
        - content creators in Web3
        - Web3 companies selling to Web2/3
        - Gaming firms
        - Consumer
        - Science
        - B2B
- Today, each wallet functions as a debit card. We envision a credit line for every wallet so that people can borrow or spend as needed, similar to a credit card in real life.
    - a business could have revolving credit facility based on the on and offchain revenue underwriting
    - individuals could have on-chain credit card (wallet), with a limit linked and signalled against their off-chain credit score for example

---

## Project Description

Today, each wallet functions as a debit card. We envision a credit line for every wallet so that people can borrow or spend as needed, similar to a credit card in real life.

Credit Wallet built using multisig Account Abstraction on ZKSync

Business or individuals can have credit facility underwritten by on- and off-chain signals utilising Huma Protocol

- data sources - Circle Business Account, Stripe, Request

- credit scoring - Spectral, Flock

Users can make payments to the vendors and sellers directly from the Huma Pool via ZKBob to keep vendor details private

In case of late or default on repayments of the credit, protocol takes ownership of the revenue receiving contracts


## Stack
- Dapp (React) using Web3Modal
- Multisig Account Abstraction for the credit wallet, with second sig for potential guarantor to co-sign on the credit line
- Deployed on ZKSync
- Integrates Circle (customer of our user makes payments to the credit wallet)
- Signal Adapter (python app) for Huma to get data from:
	- Circle Business Account 
	- Stripe
	- credit score from Spectral and Flock
	- Request.finance invoices as collateral
- Evaluation Agent (python app) to consume signals and underwrite credit
- ZKBob for transfers (direct deposits) from Pool to the end-user (https://docs.zkbob.com/resources/hackathons/zkbob-direct-deposits)
- In case of default, the pool takes ownership of contracts receiving revenue
- Dapp built using React
	- login with Web3Modal
	- connect Stripe and Cricle keys to feed Signal Adapter
	- Calculate credit limit by Evaluation Agent

# Deployment instructions

## Run commands

- Smart contracts (huma protocol contracts modified for our use)
- Signal Adapters
- Evaluation Agent
- Dapp (TBC)

**ETHEREUM**

# Account 6 has sufficient test usdc as a lender
# Account 7 and later can be used as borrowers

# start a new terminal
yarn deploy

# all deployed contract addresses can be found in deployment/localhost-deployed-contracts.json
# If some error happens and you need to start over, run: yarn clear, then deploy again
```

**Signal Adapters**

```bash
# Signal Adapters API server
cd joey-mono/signal-adapters

# update dotenv file from a copy of example.env
huma_signals/dotenv/development.env

curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
poetry install

# run the server
make run-local
```
