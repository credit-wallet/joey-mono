Welcome to Joey Finance!

# ðŸ‘€Â Problem

- At the moment itâ€™s difficult for web3 companies/entities to receive funding and loans for growth against the on-chain (and off-chain) revenue. For the space the grow, funding is key. Traditional financial institutions do not have the know-how to serve them.
    - Types of customers
        - content creators in Web3
        - Web3 companies selling to Web2/3
        - Gaming firms
        - Consumer
        - Science
        - B2B
- Today, each wallet functions as a debit card. We envision a credit line for every wallet so that people can borrow or spend as needed, similar to a credit card in real life.
    - a business could have revolving credit facility based on the on and offchain revenue underwriting
    - individuals could have on-chain credit card (wallet), with a limit linked and signalled against their off-chain credit score for example

---

# ðŸ’­Â Proposal

We can build on top of Huma - [https://docs.huma.finance/](https://docs.huma.finance/)

Huma for lending, contracts, Signal and Evaluation Agents

- use EIP4337 for the account abstraction for the credit wallet
    - ZK for privacy
- use on-chain (and off-chain) revenue data to add credit line to the users wallet. User can spent up to that amount on the credit wallet via Evaluation Agent assessment.
- Repayment happens directly to the Huma pool from the borrowers wallet (streaming payments?)
- create signal adapters from Stripe, Plaid, credit scoring (FICO) others - [https://docs.huma.finance/developer-guidlines/decentralized_signal_portfolio](https://docs.huma.finance/developer-guidlines/decentralized_signal_portfolio)
    - can utilize prediction algorithms and credit risk scoring model to assess potential borrowing risk
- angle the app to help lend to e-commerce companies, digital creators in emerging economies

Benefits of account abstraction

- can add social recovery - since itâ€™s a smart contract, can add there second keys
- fraud monitoring with 2FA

## Brief Description

Today, each wallet functions as a debit card. We envision a credit line for every wallet so that people can borrow or spend as needed, similar to a credit card in real life. 

- Credit Wallet built using ZKSync Account Abstraction
- business or individuals could have credit card (credit wallet) facility underwritten by on- and off-chain signals utilizing Huma Protocol
    - offchain data sources - Circle Business Account, Stripe
    - onchain credit scoring - Spectral, Flock
- Users could make payments to the vendors and sellers directly from the Huma Pool via ZKBob to keep purchase details private

# Deployment instructions

## Run commands

- Smart contracts (huma protocol contracts modified for our use)
- Signal Adapters
- Evaluation Agent
- Dapp (TBC)

**ETHEREUM**

### **Mono Repo**

**Smart contracts**

```bash
# clone mono repo
gh repo clone credit-wallet/joey-mono

# smart contracts
cd smart-contracts
yarn install
yarn build
yarn test
yarn chain

# with yarn chain, the console will print out 20 testing accounts
# Account 6 has sufficient test usdc as a lender
# Account 7 and later can be used as borrowers

# start a new terminal
yarn deploy

# all deployed contract addresses can be found in deployment/localhost-deployed-contracts.json
# If some error happens and you need to start over, run: yarn clear, then deploy again
```

**Signal Adapters**

```bash
# Signal Adapters API server
cd joey-mono/signal-adapters

# update dotenv file from a copy of example.env
huma_signals/dotenv/development.env

# install poetry
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
poetry install

# run the server
make run-local
```

**Evaluation Agent**

```bash
# Start the EvaluationAgent service: 
cd joey-mono/evaluation-agent
pip install git+https://github.com/zksync-sdk/zksync-python.git
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip install zksync2
python3 main.py
```

**Evaluation Agent endpoints**

```markdown
# POST /approve
**params**
	poolAddress: str
  borrowerWalletAddress: str

**Result**
{
    "creditLimit": 300000000,
    "intervalInDays": 30,
    "remainingPeriods": 12,
    "aprInBps": 0
}

# POST /underwrite
**params**
	poolAddress: str
  borrowerWalletAddress: str
  creditLimit: float

**Result** 
{
    "creditLimit": 300000000,
    "intervalInDays": 30,
    "remainingPeriods": 12,
    "aprInBps": 0
}

```

## ZKSync deployment

**ZKSync chain and smart contracts**

```bash
# close git repot
gh repo clone credit-wallet/joey-mono
# Start the local nodes

# install Docker first

# To run zkSync locally, run the start.sh script:
cd zkchain-setup
./start.sh

# deploy smart contracts on zksync
gh repo clone credit-wallet/huma-contracts-zk
cd huma-contracts-zk
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network zkTestnet
```

**Signal Adapters**

```bash
# Signal Adapters API server
cd joey-mono/signal-adapters

curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
poetry install

# run the server
make run-local
```

**Evaluation Agent**

```bash
# Start the EvaluationAgent service: 
cd joey-mono/evaluation-agent
pip install git+https://github.com/zksync-sdk/zksync-python.git
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip install zksync2
python3 main.py
```

**Setup Metamask**

```bash
# Local L1 network
# Network Name: L1 local
New RPC URL: http://localhost:8545/
Chain ID: 9
Currency Symbol: ETH
Local zkSync network

# Network Name: L2 local zkSync
New RPC URL: http://localhost:3050/
Chain ID: 270
Currency Symbol: ETH
```

Update for ZK

```bash
# evaluation agent, huma_pool.py
self.w3 = Web3(HTTPProvider("http://0.0.0.0:3050"))

# metamask
# Network Name: L2 local zkSync
New RPC URL: http://localhost:3050/
Chain ID: 270
Currency Symbol: ETH
```
